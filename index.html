      <p>This morning I woke up to dozens of messages from students who had read an article titled ”Please Don’t Learn to Code.”</p>
      <p>At first, I assumed Jeff Atwood’s 2012 article had spontaneously reappeared on Reddit. But no – this was a brand new Tech Crunch article of the same name, which echoed Atwood’s assertion that encouraging everyone to learn programming is like encouraging everyone to learn plumbing.</p>
